# Project Ideas
here are 20 IoT ideas that you can create using Raspberry Pico and MicroPython with relay, neopixel, buzzer, ultrasonic module, PIR sensor, soil moisture sensor, gas detection, DHT22 sensor, and photocell sensor:

1. Smart Plant Watering System: Use the soil moisture sensor to measure plant moisture levels, control a relay to activate a water pump, and use a neopixel to indicate when the plant has been watered.

2. Smart Home Security System: Use a PIR sensor to detect motion, activate an alarm with a buzzer, and use a neopixel to indicate when the alarm is activated.

3. Smart Garage Door Opener: Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a car is approaching the garage door, control a relay to open the door, and use a neopixel to indicate when the door is open.

4. Smart Air Quality Monitor: Use a gas detection sensor to measure air quality, use a neopixel to indicate the air quality level, and send alerts to you when air quality is poor.

5. Smart Light Control System: Use a photocell sensor to detect light levels, control a relay to turn on/off the lights, and use a neopixel to indicate when the lights are on/off.

6. Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitor: Use a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, use a neopixel to indicate the temperature and humidity levels, and send alerts to you when levels are outside of a certain range.

7. Smart Pet Feeder: Use a PIR sensor to detect when the pet is nearby, control a relay to dispense food, and use a neopixel to indicate when the food has been dispensed.

8. Smart Doorbell: Use a PIR sensor to detect when someone is at the door, use a neopixel to indicate the doorbell is activated, and send alerts to you when someone is at the door.

9. Smart Water Tank Level Monitor: Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in a tank, use a neopixel to indicate the water level, and send alerts to your phone when the water level is low.

10. Smart Irrigation System: Use the soil moisture sensor to measure soil moisture levels, control a relay to activate an irrigation system, and use a neopixel to indicate when the irrigation system is activated.

11. Smart Smoke Detector: Use a gas detection sensor to detect smoke, activate an alarm with a buzzer, and use a neopixel to indicate when the alarm is activated.

12. Smart Parking System: Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a car in a parking spot, use a neopixel to indicate when the parking spot is occupied, or is available.

13. Smart Thermostat: Use a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, control a relay to activate the heating/cooling system, and use a neopixel to indicate when the system is activated.

14. Smart Aquarium: Use the soil moisture sensor to measure water levels, control a relay to activate a water pump, and use a neopixel to indicate when the water has been changed.

15. Smart Waste Management System: Use a PIR sensor to detect when someone approaches the trash can, use a neopixel to indicate when the trash can is full, and send alerts to your phone when the trash can needs to be emptied.

16. Smart Bike Lock: Use a PIR sensor to detect when someone is attempting to unlock the bike, activate an alarm with a buzzer, and use a neopixel to indicate when the alarm is activated.

17. Smart Greenhouse: Use the soil moisture sensor to measure soil moisture levels, control a relay to activate a watering system, and use a neopixel to indicate when the watering system is activated.

18. Smart Door Lock: Use a PIR sensor to detect when someone is approaching the door, control a relay to unlock the door, and use a neopixel to indicate when the door is locked/unlocked.

19. Smart Air Freshener: Use a gas detection sensor to measure air quality, control a relay to activate an air freshener, and use a neopixel to indicate when the air freshener is activated.

20. Smart Energy Monitor: Use a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, use a photocell sensor to detect light levels, and use a neopixel to indicate when energy usage is high, and alarms you.
